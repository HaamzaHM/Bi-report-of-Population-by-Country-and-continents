It's getting crowded here.

A hundred years ago, in the beginning of the 20th century the entire world population was less than 2 billion people.

Today, in 2020, the current world population has exceeded 7 billions (7,299,000,000).

The worldâ€™s population is growing by 200,000 people a day!, but death and birth rates have declined over the past several decades. (World Bank)
